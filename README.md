Building a Next Best Action model for Standard Bank

Modern customer analytics and personalization systems use a wide variety of methods that help to reveal and quantify customer preferences and intent, making marketing messages, ads, offers, and recommendations more relevant and engaging. However, most of these methods are designed to optimize only one immediate interaction with a customer and use objective functions defined through metrics like a click-through rate (CTR) or conversion rate (CR). This problem can be particularly important in industries like retail banking and telecom where customer relationships evolve over long periods of time.
